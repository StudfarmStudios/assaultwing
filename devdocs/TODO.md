# Developer TODO list

This is a rough list of things to do for the near term development:

- Browsing of lan servers
- Selecting listening IP, Port on server
- Test Ipv6 support
- Server settings:
  - Server name
  - Lan only server
  - Game mode
  - Round time
  - Listen port / ipv6
- Authenticated Steam server
- Re-enable intro video playback somehow
