As you may well know, Battlefront Statistics show how well each registered Assault Wing pilot is currently doing. Here's a little explanation on what the numbers mean. The statistics are counted only from arenas played on the official Assault Wing game servers (usually named AW Server 1 or AW Server 2).

Score - The sum of scores earned in all the areas you've played. Currently one kill earns you two points and one death makes you lose one point.

Rating - A rough measure of who has won who in previous battles. The rating is computed as an Elo rating. A pilot with a larger rating than another pilot is likely to end up at a better position in a battle where those two pilots played. A pilot's ranking increases if he is positioned higher in an arena's final standings than was forecasted by the previous ratings of all the pilots who participated in that arena. Winning against underdogs doesn't affect your ranking significantly. If you participate in an arena for less than half of its duration, your rating won't change after that arena. Hanging in the lobby doesn't count as participation.

Note that the rating algorithm was changed on 2012-01-06 to better reflect how pilots ended up in the final standings of each arena. The previous rating algorithm emphasized kills to final standings.

Kills - The total count of how many opponent ships you've blown up.

Deaths - The total count of how many times you've been blown up.

Suicides - The total count of how many times you've been blown up without anyone scoring a kill. This may happen if you die flying into a wall or by damage from your own bullets. Note that if an opponent has damaged you during the last five seconds, he will get the kill even if you die by your own hand.

Victories - How many times you've ended up at the first place in an arena's standings. A split first place counts as a victory to each of the winning pilots.

Most used - This shows which kind of ship, secondary weapon and ship modification you have used the most throughout all battles. Usage is counted from the time you have flown with each ship, weapon and modification.
