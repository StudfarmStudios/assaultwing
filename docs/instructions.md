# Instructions   

Here's quick instructions on how to play Assault Wing.

## Installing

**TODO: The Installing section is out of date. The installer is not available and does not
work anymore. Update with Steam based information for the Steam launch.**

You can install Assault Wing from http://www.assaultwing.com/install. Just click
on the Install Assault Wing link and click Install, or Allow or Run if it asks
you questions. The installer will download and install all prerequisites
automatically. The installer will create an icon on your desktop where you can
launch Assault Wing. The desktop icon will check for updates each time you
launch the game, and it is always a good idea to let it do the update.

## Starting a Local Game — Quick Play

Once you get Assault Wing running, the easiest way to try it out is to play a
local game. Just select Play Local and then `F10` to start the game.

## Controls

Assault Wing is played either on a keyboard or on an XBox 360 controller. You
can set up the controls in the Setup menu. It offers keyboard and game pad
presets and also allows you to configure each control separately. The default
keys are as follows.

- `Up Arrow`: Thrust your ship
- `Left Arrow`, Right Arrow: Turn your ship
- `Down Arrow`: Engage your ship modification
- `Right Ctrl`: Fire your ship's weapon
- `Right Shift`: Fire your special weapon

In local game the second player has these keys by default:

- `W`: Thrust your ship
- `A`, `D`: Turn your ship
- `S`: Engage your ship modification
- `Left Ctrl`: Fire your ship's weapon
- `Left Shift`: Fire your special weapon

Pressing `Esc` will bring up an in-game dialog that allows you to end the game or
return back to the ship selection screen. Pressing `PrintScreen` during game will
save a screenshot to "`Pictures\Assault Wing`".

# Choosing Your Ship and Equipment

When choosing Play Local or when joining a server in network play, you are
presented with a ship selection screen. Pressing `F10` or game pad Start will
start the game. Before that you might want to choose your ship and equipment,
though. Use the arrow and `WASD` keys or your game pads to move your selector up
and down and to change your selection. You can choose your ship, your special
weapon and your ship modification. Short descriptions of these are shown next to
your selection. Some ships, weapons and modifications are better suited for
two-player games and some better for large battles. Try them out!

If you have joined a network game but haven't logged in with your registered
pilot, you can also enter your name as the topmost selection. Pressing `Tab` or
game pad Shoulders will cycle through the menu tabs: Equipment, Players, Chat,
Game Settings.

# Playing at the Battlefront — Multiplayer over the Internet

**TODO: The Battlefront section is out of date. The matchmaking server does not respond. Update with Steam related information for the Steam launch.**

Assault Wing is the most fun when many players play over the Internet. The
easiest way is to go to the Battlefront web page. It shows a list of active game
servers. Just click on Quick Play to join a game server. Please note that in
order join a game from the web site Assault Wing must already be installed on
your computer.

You can also join a game server from Assault Wing menus. To do this, start
Assault Wing and choose Play at the Battlefront in the main menu. You will be
shown a list of available game servers (with current pilot counts). At the
bottom of the screen you will also see a countdown to the next scheduled game.
Scheduled games are casual events that help players join the servers together.
This way we can have larger battles even if there aren't players online at all
times.

Before joining a server, you can register yourself a pilot and log in with it.
If you have done this already previously, the game will remember it and log you
in automatically each time you enter the Battlefront. In the Battlefront menu
there is a submenu called Log in with Your Pilot. It contains the Register a New
Pilot item which links to http://www.assaultwing.com/battlefront/#!/register.
After registering yourself a pilot, enter its name and password in the Login
menu and press "Log in!". If the login is successful, you will see your pilot
name appear next to the "Log in!" item. Playing with a registered pilot is extra
fun because you can then follow your battle statistics and ranking at
http://www.assaultwing.com/battlefront

Press `Enter` or game pad `A` on a server that has some players or is otherwise
to your liking and you'll join the server. You're now presented with the ship
selection screen. Pressing `F10` or game pad Start will join the ongoing battle.
During a network game, you can change your ship and weapons by pressing Esc, and
then re-join the battle by pressing F10 or game pad Start. Your new selections
will be activated when you die. Note that the battle doesn't stop when you're
re-equipping!

Keep an eye on the forums for scheduled battles!
