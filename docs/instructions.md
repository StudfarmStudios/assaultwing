# Instructions   

Here's quick instructions on how to play Assault Wing.

## Installing

You can install Assault Wing from [Steam for free.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971370/Assault_Wing/)

## Starting a Local Game — Quick Play

Once you get Assault Wing running, the easiest way to try it out is to play a
local game.  Use `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` to select menu entries and `Enter`
to activate. (No no mouse support ATM.) Just select `Play
Local` and then `F10` to start the game.

To play online select `Play at the Battlefront`. Wait a few seconds and at least
the `Join Official 1` server should appear.

You can also hit `Create server` to create a local server that all other players
can join. (A terminal based dedicated server is also available as a separate
installation.)

## Controls

Assault Wing is played either on a keyboard or on an XBox 360 controller. You
can set up the controls in the Setup menu. It offers keyboard and game pad
presets and also allows you to configure each control separately. The default
keys are as follows.

- `Up Arrow`: Thrust your ship
- `Left Arrow`, Right Arrow: Turn your ship
- `Down Arrow`: Engage your ship modification
- `Right Ctrl`: Fire your ship's weapon
- `Right Shift`: Fire your special weapon

In local game the second player has these keys by default:

- `W`: Thrust your ship
- `A`, `D`: Turn your ship
- `S`: Engage your ship modification
- `Left Ctrl`: Fire your ship's weapon
- `Left Shift`: Fire your special weapon

Pressing `Esc` will bring up an in-game dialog that allows you to end the game or
return back to the ship selection screen. Pressing `PrintScreen` during game will
save a screenshot to "`Pictures\Assault Wing`".

# Choosing Your Ship and Equipment

When choosing Play Local or when joining a server in network play, you are
presented with a ship selection screen. Pressing `F10` or game pad Start will
start the game. Before that you might want to choose your ship and equipment,
though. Use the arrow and `WASD` keys or your game pads to move your selector up
and down and to change your selection. You can choose your ship, your special
weapon and your ship modification. Short descriptions of these are shown next to
your selection. Some ships, weapons and modifications are better suited for
two-player games and some better for large battles. Try them out!

If you have joined a network game but haven't logged in with your registered
pilot, you can also enter your name as the topmost selection. Pressing `Tab` or
game pad Shoulders will cycle through the menu tabs: Equipment, Players, Chat,
Game Settings.

# Playing at the Battlefront — Multiplayer over the Internet

Assault Wing is the most fun when many players play over the Internet. Use
the `Play at the Battlefront` menu to create and join games.

You can also join a game server from Assault Wing menus. To do this, start
Assault Wing and choose Play at the Battlefront in the main menu. At the
bottom of the screen you will also see a countdown to the next scheduled game.
Scheduled games are casual events that help players join the servers together.
This way we can have larger battles even if there aren't players online at all
times.

Your Steam nick name is used as your player name, but it can be customized
from the Setup menu.

After playing online you will be assigned a _rating_. Rating is calculated
using a system similar to the one used in Chess. If you win against powerful
opponents your rating will increase proportionally. The rating starts at 1000
and will go up and down depending on your placement at the end of matches.

Your _rank_ is simply your position in the global ranking sorted by each
players' _rating_ number. Your current rank and rating will be visible in the
yellow area in the top right corner of the screen in menus. The ranking/rating
is powered by a Steam Leaderboard.

Press `Enter` or game pad `A` on a server that has some players or is otherwise
to your liking and you'll join the server. You're now presented with the ship
selection screen. Pressing `F10` or game pad Start will join the ongoing battle.
During a network game, you can change your ship and weapons by pressing Esc, and
then re-join the battle by pressing F10 or game pad Start. Your new selections
will be activated when you die. Note that the battle doesn't stop when you're
re-equipping!
