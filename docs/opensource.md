# Assault Wing â€” Open Source

tweaking something or developing the game further, by all means go have a stab
at it :-)

Also, the public game server "AW Server 1" will go offline on 2013-03-27. The
server cost us money and there weren't many players to be served. The
matchmaking server and the website will stay online, however. It will be
possible to play the game over the internet also in the future. One of the
players will have to start a server that the others can then join. This requires
that the server's traffic is not blocked by any firewall. Playing in a LAN
should work without problems like before.
