# Assault Wing â€” Requirements

Assault Wing runs on computers that have some fairly recent Windows operating
system (7, Vista, XP, and the likes).

Assault Wing installer ensures automatically you have these necessary pieces of
software installed, so in any normal case you won't have to worry about these:

    Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile
    Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0


Your computer must also have a graphics adapter that

    supports DirectX 9.0 (all even remotely modern ones do) and
    supports Shader Model 2.0 (most adapters do)
    has at least 256 MB of graphics memory


The game can be played on a keyboard. Also XBox 360 controller are fully
supported. Note that if you have a PS3 controller, you can use MotioninJoy to
turn it into an XBox 360 controller.
